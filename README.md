# Facebook Ad Approvals WP Plugin
###A WP plugin for sending Facebook ad proofs to clients and obtaining feedback and approvals.

This plugin allows a creative team to quickly and easily share Facebook ad proofs with their clients. Clients see the ads exactly as they would appear within Facebook itself. 

Users will only be able to access a page if they follow the link generated by the app by the publisher. If they attempt to access a page directly, they are required to enter the client email address associated with the page. If the client email does not match, they are not given access. This prevents unauthorized approvals from being submitted.

The plugin allows clients to send their feedback directly from the same screen they view the ads. This results in quicker feedback and a shorter ad creation cycle. Copy writers and designers can easily update ads based on client feedback and resend ad links for approval.
